## Filedgr Core: Integrating IPFS for Enhanced Data Management

At the heart of Filedgr's ecosystem is an IPFS fork that implements access control and data redundancy, making it suitable for enterprise use.

**Data Redundancy**
Filedgr ensures data redundancy through a Java sidecar application that monitors and manages data availability using the Zookeeper framework. This system guarantees that data is always accessible and reliable.

**Access Control**
Access control in Filedgr is implemented via token gating. Digital certificates are hosted as Single Page Applications (SPAs) on a Private IPFS Cluster, ensuring secure and token-gated access to data.


## Leveraging the XRP Ledger (XRPL)

Filedgr integrates with the XRP Ledger to enhance transparency and efficiency in data management. XRPL's fast transaction speeds and low costs make it an ideal choice for Filedgr's needs, particularly for managing the lifecycle information of products without incurring high costs.

By integrating with the XRP Ledger, Filedgr enhances its capabilities, providing secure, transparent, and efficient data management solutions.

**Why XRPL?** 

* **Efficiency**: XRPL offers high transaction speeds and low fees, crucial for Filedgr's extensive data transactions.
* **Transparency**: By using XRPL, Filedgr ensures that all data interactions are transparent and verifiable.
* **NFT Support**: XRPL's support for NFTs allows Filedgr to manage digital certificates efficiently, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data.

Filedgr's integration with XRPL was recognized with a developer grant, underscoring the platform's commitment to leveraging decentralized technology for innovative solutions.

## Future Goals: DAO and Venture Builder Model

Filedgr aims to evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), promoting transparency and community-driven governance. The Filedgr Foundation will oversee the DAO, ensuring efficient operations. Additionally, Filedgr plans to develop industry-specific spin-offs, tailoring its technology to various sectors like farming and mobility.
